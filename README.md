## Introduction
My name is Divya and I'm in 10th grade! My favorite subject is math and I'm currently in cheer as a sport. Somethings I like to do in my freetime include watching movies, eating, or hanging out with my friends. My favorite fast food is Taco Bell. My favorite thing to get there is the cravings box which comes with a chalupa, burrito, chips and cheese, and a drink. I also order nacho fries which is the best thing in the whole world. Aside from eating, I also love traveling! I've been to Hawaii, Kentucky, Texas, Nevada, Arizona, New York, New Jersey, Oklahoma, and out of state countries!


This summer was pretty eventful! I traveled to Kauai, Hawaii and we explored the whole island. We saw places that Lilo and Stitch was inspired from. While we stayed, I did mountain tubing, boat riding, driving ATVs, and more! I also saw a lot of wildlife such as turtles and dolphins.


My favorite movie is the Parent Trap. I like this movie because it has a mix of comedy, romance, and sisterhood. I could definitely watch it 10 times more and still wouldn't get tired of it. I also really like the actor Lindsay Lohan so it was more enjoyable knowing she acted in it. She was also in Mean Girls which was a fun movie to watch!
